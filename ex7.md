#### 1. Give an expression for the time complexity of the reverse() implementation. Explain how you reached the conclusion describing your step-by-step reasoning. [0.3 pts]

The time complexity of the reverse implementation is O(n). In the function there is a for loop which contains an if else statement. The for loop will be run for the length of the list and either the if statement or the else statement will be run once during each iteration. This leaves us with a complexity of O(n).

#### 2. Design an optimized implementation of the same function with better performance. Discuss which changes you made and how they should be expected to result in a better function [0.3 pts]
