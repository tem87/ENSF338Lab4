Compare advantages and disadvantages of arrays vs linked list
(complexity of task completion) [0.1 pts]
2. For arrays, we are interested in implementing a replace function
that acts as a deletion followed by insertion. How can this function
be implemented to minimize the impact of each of the standalone
tasks? [0.1 pts]

3. Assuming you are tasked to implement a doubly linked list with a
sort function, given the list of sort functions below, state the
feasibility of using each one of them and elaborate why is it
possible or not to use them. [0.4 pts]
1. Insertion sort
2. Merge sort
4. Also show the expected complexity for each and how it differs from
applying it to a regular array
